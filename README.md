# Музыкальный дискорд-бот

Это тестовый бот для воспроизведения музыки из выбранного видео с ютуб. Чтобы им воспользоваться, установите PY 3.10+, установите бибилиотеку FFmpeg, после чего в файле config.py установите токен своего бота, откройте файл bot.py.

🎵 Музыкальные команды:
!play <ссылка> - Загружает трек с указанной YouTube-ссылки и добавляет его в очередь. Если бот еще не воспроизводит музыку, начинает проигрывание.
!pause - Ставит текущий трек на паузу.
!stop - Останавливает воспроизведение музыки и очищает очередь треков.
!plist - Показывает список треков, находящихся в очереди.

🔊 Системные команды:
!join - Заставляет бота присоединиться к голосовому каналу, в котором находится пользователь, отправивший команду.
!leave - Заставляет бота покинуть голосовой канал.

The application does not support the English language at the moment; if there are future updates, translation into any language will most likely be added.
